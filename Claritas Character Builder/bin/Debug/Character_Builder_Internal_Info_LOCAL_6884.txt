KinDarkElf
Dark elves mostly reside on an island to the east of Wilshire, ruled by a Monarchical government that is at the center of dark elf life. Dark elves all have a strong sense of civic duty, and those who strike out for their own purposes away from their island are uncommon, with those who actively oppose their government being exceedingly rare. Physically, dark elves resemble other elves only superficially; being of a similar average height and a proportionally slim build. Other than bone structure, dark elves are quite different from the typical high elves and wood elves. Most noticeably, their skin is a slightly pale and bluish with veins more noticeable than in other humanoid kin; appearing like a human whom is short of breath, or choking. Their eyes are invariably a dark ruddy brown, appearing black from a distance, with the only exceptions being seen in aged individuals (whom are few and far between) whose typical dark red-brown irises have begun to change to one of any normal human eye color. Their voices are naturally gravely, although this is somewhat less apparent in dark elves who do not hail from their traditional island nation, as the Wilshire continental accent helps it sound to more normative to non-elven ears.

KinDryad
Dryads are slightly larger than most humans. They have dark to light brown skin and bark covering them. The amount of bark on individuals vary. Their hair is made up of leaves such as long thin leaves, locust leaves, or pine needles depending on what climate they’re from. Their eyes are deep green and almond shaped and their faces are slightly flatter than normal. Dryads are a kind and calm people, but they never let their decisions be made for them. If anyone or anything tries to make them move or change their mind the Dryads will not budge. Even in the wake of war Dryads would rather fortify their city and hold than move.

KinDwarf
Dwarves are slightly short, very sturdy mountain-dwelling people with a broad frame. They are typically very fond of caves and have excellent manual craftsmanship, they tend to make expert miners and metalworkers, and formidable warriors. They tend to have a very expensive taste and a love of luxury, with a particular penchant for gold and jewels. Dwarves have a strong sense of pride in their family, accomplishments, and beard. Your beard is your first impression of pride and strength to another dwarf, thus if a dwarven beard is not well maintained, its owner will not be respected by their fellow members of Dwarven society.Dwarves have will of iron and a heart of fire. When a dwarf sets their mind on something, there is little that can stop them from accomplishing it.

KinGnome 
Gnomes are short and stout, and their head come to a gentle point. They are highly-intelligent and creative beings who tend to be quite unpleasant to other intelligent races. Gnomes are often extremely prejudiced against non-gnomes and tend to be short tempered as well. Not all gnomes feel like this however, and their incredible aptitude for inventing and tinkering with small, intricately crafted items makes them highly appreciated in diverse societies. In fact, the incredibly fine craftsmanship of their little inventions surpasses even dwarven technology, in many ways.

KinGoblin 
Goblins average around 4 to 5 feet tall. They are thin with smooth green to brown skin. They have slightly pointed ears, long arms, shorter legs, thin black hair and large eyes. Goblins are light on their feet and nimble and are quick to catch onto things and learn.

KinHighElf 
High elves are relatively uncommon outside their homeland in the Golden Dove kingdom. They are often very proud of their heritage, and most of them hundreds, if not thousands, of years old. Not naturally inclined to put themselves at risk, they often prefer archery to keep danger at a distance. However, this isn't usually necessary, as they are the most magic-affine kin among those commonly found around Wilshire, with a large percentage of their population  being able to use magic. For this reason, as well as their ever-graceful appearances and suitably haughty demeanor, they are often seen as prim cowards.

KinJadeImperial 
The Jade Imperials stand between 5’5’’ and 5’10’’. They have an average weight of 160 lb. Their hair is primarily brown and black. Their skin ranges between tan and pale and appears slightly translucent similar to the quality of jade. When a Jade Imperial dies their body is converted into a variety jade depending on their life style. Most of the infrastructure of jade imperial cities is made from jade. Jade imperials are known for their ambition, this shows through in the strength of their central government, strong military, progressive society, and shrewd business dealing.

KinNyad 
Nyads human like in shape with blue to green skin, light lined patterns on their skin down the middle of their bodies and limbs and splotches of scales. Their skin is halfway between human and fish skin. Their feet are webbed and their hands are webbed halfway up the fingers. Their ears have fins/webbing coming off of them resembling the shape of elf ears. Their teeth come to a point, they have slitted eyes and gills under their ears. Different Nyads can potentially have different colored accents on their webbing or patterns. You can tell geographically where a nyad is from by its skin tone. Darker colors are from deeper ocean or ocean shelfs, lighter colors are from the shallows, brighter colors are from reefs, and there are a very small number of river nyads that tend to be a more brown color. River nyads also have a more streamlined body and features. They are easy going, follow rules that are in place well, and are very conscious about keeping things clean and tidy
