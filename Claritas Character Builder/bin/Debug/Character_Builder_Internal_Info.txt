KinDarkElf
Dark Elf - Prowess M, Average Height 6‚Äô6‚Äô‚Äô
	Description: Dark elves mostly reside on an island to the east of Wilshire, ruled by a Monarchical government that is at the center of dark elf life. Dark elves all have a strong sense of civic duty, and those who strike out for their own purposes away from their island are uncommon, with those who actively oppose their government being exceedingly rare. Physically, dark elves resemble other elves only superficially; being of a similar average height and a proportionally slim build. Other than bone structure, dark elves are quite different from the typical high elves and wood elves. Most noticeably, their skin is a slightly pale and bluish with veins more noticeable than in other humanoid kin; appearing like a human whom is short of breath, or hypothermic. Their eyes are invariably a dark ruddy brown, appearing black from a distance. The only exceptions are seen in aged individuals (whom are very rare) whose typical dark red-brown irises have begun to change to one of any normal human eye color. Their voices are naturally gravely, although this is somewhat less apparent in dark elves who do not hail from their traditional island nation, as the Wilshire continental accent helps it sound to more normative to non-elven ears.

KinDwarf
Dwarves are slightly short, very sturdy mountain-dwelling people with a broad frame. They are typically very fond of caves and have excellent manual craftsmanship, they tend to make expert miners and metalworkers, and formidable warriors. They tend to have a very expensive taste and a love of luxury, with a particular penchant for gold and jewels. Dwarves have a strong sense of pride in their family, accomplishments, and beard. Your beard is your first impression of pride and strength to another dwarf, thus if a dwarven beard is not well maintained, its owner will not be respected by their fellow members of Dwarven society.Dwarves have will of iron and a heart of fire. When a dwarf sets their mind on something, there is little that can stop them from accomplishing it.

Szhoom usually stand between 2‚Äô and 3‚Äô tall and generally have a larger frame than other fairies. Despite their bigger size, their wings remain about the size of most fairies causing them to appear awkwardly small. All of these kinds of fairy are not exclusive and can be mixed ie. a fairy can be both a Szhoom and an Ahlookaro.
	The Fairy kingdom is split into four nations: Earth, Water, Wind, and Fire. all of the nations work together to try to improve the fairy kingdom as a whole. Each nation holds its own temperament.
Earth - Generally, Fairies from the earth nation express themselves through their craft. They take whatever job is required of them and make it their own. They are usually agreeable people; however, it is hard to change an earth fairy‚Äôs mind.
Water - Generally, Fairies from the water nation are observers and learners. They enjoy the freedom to observe the world around them.
Wind - Generally, Fairies from the wind nation are fleety and free. They tend to act on their instinct rather than logic. 
Fire - Generally, Fairies from the fire nation express themselves through controlled passion. They best understand cause and effect.

High Elf - Prowess M Average Height 6‚Äô6‚Äù
	Description: High elves are relatively uncommon outside their homeland in the Golden Dove kingdom. They are usually very proud of their heritage, and most of them hundreds, if not thousands, of years old. Not naturally inclined to put themselves at risk, they often prefer archery to keep danger at a distance. However, this isn't usually necessary, as they are the most magic-affine kin among those commonly found around Wilshire, with a large majority of their kin being able to use magic. For this reason, as well as their ever-graceful appearances and suitably haughty demeanor, they are often seen as prim cowards.
