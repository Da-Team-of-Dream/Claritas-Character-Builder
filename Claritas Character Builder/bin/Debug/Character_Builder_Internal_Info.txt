KinDarkElf
Stature - Medium, Average Height 6’6"
Description: Dark elves mostly reside on an island to the east of Wilshire, ruled by a Monarchical government that is at the center of dark elf life. Dark elves all have a strong sense of civic duty, and those who strike out for their own purposes away from their island are uncommon, with those who actively oppose their government being exceedingly rare. Physically, dark elves resemble other elves only superficially; being of a similar average height and a proportionally slim build. Other than bone structure, dark elves are quite different from the typical high elves and wood elves. Most noticeably, their skin is a slightly pale and bluish with veins more noticeable than in other humanoid kin; appearing like a human whom is short of breath, or hypothermic. Their eyes are invariably a dark ruddy brown, appearing black from a distance. The only exceptions are seen in aged individuals (whom are very rare) whose typical dark red-brown irises have begun to change to one of any normal human eye color. Their voices are naturally gravely, although this is somewhat less apparent in dark elves who do not hail from their traditional island nation, as the Wilshire continental accent helps it sound to more normative to non-elven ears.

KinDwarf
Stature - Large, Average height 4'
Dwarves are slightly short, very sturdy mountain-dwelling people with a broad frame. They are typically very fond of caves and have excellent manual craftsmanship, they tend to make expert miners and metalworkers, and formidable warriors. They tend to have a very expensive taste and a love of luxury, with a particular penchant for gold and jewels. Dwarves have a strong sense of pride in their family, accomplishments, and beard. Your beard is your first impression of pride and strength to another dwarf, thus if a dwarven beard is not well maintained, its owner will not be respected by their fellow members of Dwarven society.Dwarves have will of iron and a heart of fire. When a dwarf sets their mind on something, there is little that can stop them from accomplishing it.

Szhoom usually stand between 2’ and 3’ tall and generally have a larger frame than other fairies. Despite their bigger size, their wings remain about the size of most fairies causing them to appear awkwardly small.

The Fairy kingdom is split into four nations: Earth, Water, Wind, and Fire. all of the nations work together to try to improve the fairy kingdom as a whole. Each nation holds its own temperament.
Earth - Generally, Fairies from the earth nation express themselves through their craft. They take whatever job is required of them and make it their own. They are usually agreeable people; however, it is hard to change an earth fairy’s mind.
Water - Generally, Fairies from the water nation are observers and learners. They enjoy the freedom to observe the world around them.
Wind - Generally, Fairies from the wind nation are fleety and free. They tend to act on their instinct rather than logic.

Stature - Small, Average Height – 1’
Gnomes are short and stout, and their head come to a gentle point. They are highly-intelligent and creative beings who tend to be quite unpleasant to other intelligent races. Gnomes are often extremely prejudiced against non-gnomes and tend to be short tempered as well. Not all gnomes feel like this however, and their incredible aptitude for inventing and tinkering with small, intricately crafted items makes them highly appreciated in diverse societies. In fact, the incredibly fine craftsmanship of their little inventions surpasses even dwarven technology, in many ways.

KinHighElf
Stature - Medium, Average Height 6’6”
Description: High elves are relatively uncommon outside their homeland in the Golden Dove kingdom. They are usually very proud of their heritage, and most of them hundreds, if not thousands, of years old. Not naturally inclined to put themselves at risk, they often prefer archery to keep danger at a distance. However, this isn't usually necessary, as they are the most magic-affine kin among those commonly found around Wilshire, with a large majority of their kin being able to use magic. For this reason, as well as their ever-graceful appearances and suitably haughty demeanor, they are often seen as prim cowards.

Most Jade Imperials come a small capital island that is the largest in a chain of islands known as the Jade isles. The Capital island is a densely populated city made almost entirely of jade. Although most Jades come from the Jade isles, many small Jade Imperial towns can be found along coastlines of various different nations.

The less honorable among them have the ability to master the darker side of combat, employing diseases, poisons, and stealthy armor-piercing stabs. Some rogues with a different sense of nobility and honor may find the arts of obtaining things without murder more to their tastes: With inexplicably deft movements, they can quietly take things from their enemies, or devise silver-tongued trickeries that can be useful in a variety of situations. They may not be Nobles, but some rogues pride themselves on talking like them. (get to choose 1 of their special Slots to start with are - Vanish can't move or be seen for 15 sec, hide can't move and has to be behind or next to something to be not seen until either heard or seen from behind, or invisible for 10 sec which allows you to move around and not be seen)

Modifiers
Common - Adds no additional effect or modification to player.

Half-breed - Has to be half human and half another playable kinl. Starts with one attribute and has the potential to have one attribute from each race but can't obtain a third. Weight capacity is the average of the two races selected.

Spark of insanity - Can speak with their conscience and ask one question OPIGD, but are seen as insane. 

Undead - Bound to a specific personal beacon. They will always revive for free to wherever the beacon is placed, but if they want to stay they must use an XP to remain with their current party. If the player is transported back they will leave everything on them at the place of their death. If the player dies in range of their beacon they can only XP out or make a deal with death. Can never be revived by/through miracles. The player�s beacon can be moved as long as a GM is aware and present. 20 seconds uninterrupted to place your beacon.

Vampiric - Must drink humanoid blood instead of resting. Can't be turned and can't turn others. Can't be cured.

Werewolf - Allows the player to invoke werewolf form; multiplying the player's health by three, giving them a damage reduction of 1, and automatically removing their armor. Player always has a weakness to silver and can�t rest after invocation until the player has fed. The invocation only lasts as long as a single encounter. Can�t be cured. (OPQ)

Bound weapon  - The player cannot be disarmed if they are only in possession of only one weapon but must always be in contact with at least one weapon. The only way they can not be in contact with a weapon is if they die and the weapon is taken from them. The next weapon they come into contact with restarts the effect.

Flashback - Allows the player to perfectly remember a situation/area (can even ask GM for details) but player must sleep all three watches during a night.

Indebted Soul - Cannot make deals with Death, yet cannot die in the traditional sense. When health reaches 0, body goes dormant; the soul being permanently tethered to the body. Can never be raised through necromancy. If the character dies they will be revived as though they had bribed Death with XP (XPed out). This can only be done once per event. If a player bribes death, any and all money they touch upon revival will be immediately lost, transported to the person/thing/object that revived them until they have given a total of 350 Gold. (All gold the player loses upon death counts toward their sum.)
